OVERVIEW = """\
omaudit - what can this Omarchy plugin reach?

Plugins run unsandboxed inside the long-running shell process, with your
full user permissions. omaudit is a lint: it reports capability, not intent.

Everyday
  omaudit add <git-url>       review a plugin, then install it
  omaudit check               re-audit what you already installed
  omaudit check --all         yours plus the plugins that ship with Omarchy
  omaudit help <command>      how to use one command

Look before you install
  omaudit scan <dir>          human report (no Omarchy CLI needed)
  omaudit permissions <dir>   generate a permissions block from the code

Keep a plugin honest
  omaudit baseline <dir>      accept today's capabilities
  omaudit baseline --builtin  same for every first-party plugin
  omaudit report              report card of every tracked plugin
  omaudit census              snapshot the live omarchyplugins.com listing
  omaudit verify <dir>        CI gate: fail on undeclared capabilities

Also
  omaudit badge <dir>         shields.io JSON
  omaudit schema              the capability vocabulary

Grades: A clean  B ordinary  C review it  D know what you're doing  F don't.
Exit:   0 clean  1 findings  2 invalid manifest  3 usage

Run `omaudit help add` (or any command) for flags and a worked example.

The install-time gate. Clones the plugin, prints what it actually does
in plain language, and asks before anything is written.

  omaudit add https://github.com/someone/weather-plus

    weather-plus 2.1.0 - grade D

    runs programs         curl, sh
    talks to internet     api.open-meteo.com
    ! reads credentials and can send them off-box

    Install anyway? [y/N]

Yes installs the exact reviewed checkout via `omarchy plugin add`, verifies the
installed commit and capability set, restores the upstream update remote, and
only then writes .omaudit-baseline.json for `omaudit check`. A mismatch is
removed without being accepted.

--local     treat the argument as an already-checked-out directory
            (installation requires that directory to be a Git repository)
--plugin ID select one plugin for review when a source holds several;
            remote installation still requires a root manifest
--yes / -y  skip omaudit's confirmation (still shows the sheet)

Needs the `omarchy` CLI on PATH to install. Scan-only? use `omaudit scan`.

Their baselines live in ~/.config/omaudit/baselines/, not under /usr/share.

is not mixed into `omaudit report` — report is what you installed,
census is what the site is listing.

Clones persist in ~/.cache/omaudit/clones so a re-run only fetches
sources whose listingValidatedCommit changed. Output lands in
~/.config/omaudit/census/.

Aggregates only. Naming a plugin from this output follows DISCLOSURE.md.
Do not put this on a daily cron: five hundred clones a day is rude.

Every observed capability has a weight (0-5). Declared capabilities still
count - a keylogger that admits to being a keylogger is still a keylogger.
Undeclared ones count double, but only if the manifest has a permissions
block at all. Plugins written before the schema are not punished for
having nothing to declare into.

Composition pairs add +6 regardless of justification. The ones that
matter: credentials, clipboard, keystrokes, screen, or audio, plus a
network path off-box; or dynamic code plus a network path.

plugins that predate the declaration convention.
